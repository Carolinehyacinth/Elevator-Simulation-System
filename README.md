# Elevator-Simulation-System

•	The function of the system is to simulate a running elevator to meet any situation which may happen in real life, such as the order of pressing the buttons of the passengers.

•	Technical work: Combed the overall framework about the system. Established the classes which are needed in the system. Wrote different codes to meet various conditions a running elevator would encounter and made corresponding reactions to each condition.

•	Non-technical work: Worked in a team and presented the final project. The generated result meets the intended goals.

The project is so big. So, the fold only has the main codes.
